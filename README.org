* fritz homeautomation project

I've got me some [[https://avm.de/produkte/fritzdect/][FRITZ!DECT]] outlets that can be remote controlled and that
monitor power consumption and temperature. This little uses the [[https://avm.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Global/Service/Schnittstellen/AHA-HTTP-Interface.pdf][fritz HTTP API]]
to access those features.

There is currently a Clojure server that interacts with the fritz HTTP interface
and provides it's own front end with [[https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/][vega visualizations]].
