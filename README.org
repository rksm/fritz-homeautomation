* fritz homeautomation project

I've got me some [FRITZ!DECT](https://avm.de/produkte/fritzdect/) outlets that
can be remote controlled and that monitor power consumption and temperature.
This little uses the [fritz HTTP API](https://avm.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Global/Service/Schnittstellen/AHA-HTTP-Interface.pdf)
to access those features.

There is currently a Clojure server that interacts with the fritz HTTP interface
and provides it's own front end with [vega
visualizations](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/).
